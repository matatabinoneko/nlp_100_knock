      "+1 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . .\r\n",
      "-1 what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .\r\n",

      "+1 fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life .\r\n",

      "-1 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo .\r\n",
      "+1 this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it .\r\n",
      "-1 just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation .\r\n",
      "-1 every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming .\r\n",
      "-1 piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .\r\n",

      "+1 disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself .\r\n",
      "-1 one of the most incoherent features in recent memory .\r\n",
      "-1 the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .\r\n",

      "+1 a giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say .\r\n",
      "-1 all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi .\r\n",
      "+1 it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters .\r\n",
      "-1 the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects .\r\n",
      "+1 a thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation .\r\n",
      "-1 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .\r\n",
      "-1 has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .\r\n",
      "-1 a high-minded snoozer .\r\n",
      "+1 not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly .\r\n",
      "-1 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .\r\n",
      "+1 a creaky staircase gothic .\r\n",
      "-1 jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .\r\n",
      "-1 madonna still can't act a lick .\r\n",
      "+1 a wildly entertaining scan of evans' career .\r\n",
      "-1 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination .\r\n",
      "+1 the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality\r\n",
      "-1 the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .\r\n",
      "+1 it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look .\r\n",
      "+1 the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact .\r\n",
      "+1 a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work .\r\n",
      "-1 mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .\r\n",
      "+1 tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother .\r\n",
      "-1 reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script\r\n",
      "-1 despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .\r\n",
      "+1 the movie is . . . very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes .\r\n",
      "-1 this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .\r\n",
      "+1 veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .\r\n",
      "+1 hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love .\r\n",
      "-1 is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ?\r\n",
      "-1 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good .\r\n",
      "-1 the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .\r\n",
      "-1 flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .\r\n",
      "+1 both deeply weird and charmingly dear .\r\n",
      "+1 it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns .\r\n",
      "+1 a lovely film . . . elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity .\r\n",
      "-1 if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now .\r\n",
      "+1 'the film is stark , straightforward and deadly . . . an unnatural calm that's occasionally shaken by . . . blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . '\r\n",
      "+1 writer-director's mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres .\r\n",
      "+1 you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .\r\n",
      "-1 the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious .\r\n",
      "-1 ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok .\r\n",
      "-1 although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .\r\n",
      "-1 it was a dark and stormy night . . .\r\n",
      "+1 francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them .\r\n",
      "+1 tells ( the story ) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of ( being ) in a shrugging mood .\r\n",
      "-1 feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .\r\n",
      "+1 the film has a kind of hard , cold effect .\r\n",
      "+1 not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again .\r\n",
      "+1 a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival .\r\n",
      "-1 lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .\r\n",
      "+1 highly watchable stuff .\r\n",
      "-1 it treats women like idiots .\r\n",
      "+1 a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master's steady stroke .\r\n",
      "+1 informative , intriguing , observant , often touching . . . gives a human face to what's often discussed in purely abstract terms .\r\n",
      "-1 spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .\r\n",
      "-1 feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place .\r\n",
      "-1 due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .\r\n",
      "+1 [cuarón has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy .\r\n",
      "+1 all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit .\r\n",
      "-1 this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .\r\n",
      "-1 a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .\r\n",
      "-1 deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .\r\n",
      "+1 it's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave .\r\n",
      "-1 screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .\r\n",
      "+1 a lovably old-school hollywood confection .\r\n",
      "+1 this is carion's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach .\r\n",
      "-1 this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious .\r\n",
      "+1 while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care .\r\n",
      "-1 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .\r\n",
      "-1 ararat feels like a book report\r\n",
      "-1 the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .\r\n",
      "-1 an incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .\r\n",
      "-1 every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them .\r\n",
      "+1 confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture .\r\n",
      "+1 the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly .\r\n",
      "-1 [toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material .\r\n",
      "+1 it's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything .\r\n",
      "+1 . . . if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games .\r\n",
      "-1 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .\r\n",
      "+1 will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look .\r\n",
      "-1 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece .\r\n",
      "-1 children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers .\r\n",
      "-1 the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card .\r\n",
      "-1 . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . .\r\n",
      "-1 billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .\r\n",
      "+1 a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana .\r\n",
      "-1 melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back .\r\n",
      "-1 the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .\r\n",
      "-1 kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention .\r\n",
      "+1 a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term .\r\n",
      "+1 a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia's film history .\r\n",
      "+1 there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible .\r\n",
      "+1 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie .\r\n",
      "+1 an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar ( and peculiarly venomous ) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy\r\n",
      "-1 certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either .\r\n",
      "-1 the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it\r\n",
      "+1 son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .\r\n",
      "+1 even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , east-vs . -west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate .\r\n",
      "+1 it's unlikely we'll see a better thriller this year .\r\n",
      "-1 one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .\r\n",
      "-1 wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !\r\n",
      "+1 if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere .\r\n",
      "-1 once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .\r\n",
      "-1 children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it .\r\n",
      "+1 in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .\r\n",
      "+1 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive .\r\n",
      "+1 directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology .\r\n",
      "+1 though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history .\r\n",
      "+1 notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights .\r\n",
      "-1 it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame .\r\n",
      "-1 terrible .\r\n",
      "-1 the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his .\r\n",
      "-1 the story has little wit and no surprises .\r\n",
      "+1 thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all .\r\n",
      "+1 a movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be .\r\n",
      "-1 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .\r\n",
      "+1 an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch .\r\n",
      "-1 if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .\r\n",
      "-1 the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .\r\n",
      "-1 the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .\r\n",
      "-1 this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon .\r\n",
      "+1 features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film .\r\n",
      "-1 and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !\r\n",
      "+1 admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form .\r\n",
      "-1 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit .\r\n",
      "-1 shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies .\r\n",
      "-1 ",
      " is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful .\r\n",
      "+1 there's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing .\r\n",
      "-1 resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project .\r\n",
      "+1 if it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for .\r\n",
      "+1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread .\r\n",
      "+1 this is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem .\r\n",
      "+1 cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective .\r\n",
      "-1 eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof .\r\n",
      "+1 watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown .\r\n",
      "+1 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .\r\n",
      "+1 reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .\r\n",
      "-1 'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about\r\n",
      "+1 belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film .\r\n",
      "-1 written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter .\r\n",
      "-1 no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .\r\n",
      "-1 the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine .\r\n",
      "+1 an ebullient tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing .\r\n",

      "-1 this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned .\r\n",
      "+1 greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders .\r\n",
      "+1 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered .\r\n",
      "-1 a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .\r\n",

      "-1 given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done .\r\n",
      "+1 more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them .\r\n",
      "+1 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise .\r\n",

      "+1 a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause .\r\n",
      "+1 a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother .\r\n",
      "+1 far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place . . . innocent and well-meaning .\r\n",
      "-1 anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time .\r\n",

      "-1 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut .\r\n",

      "-1 nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .\r\n",
      "+1 it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene .\r\n",

      "-1 definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .\r\n",
      "-1 the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .\r\n",

      "+1 the picture's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed .\r\n",
      "+1 what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch .\r\n",
      "+1 the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity .\r\n",
      "-1 what an embarrassment .\r\n",
      "+1 the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself .\r\n",

      "-1 there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening .\r\n",
      "+1 it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing .\r\n",
      "+1 lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness .\r\n",
      "+1 in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters  damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .\r\n",

      "+1 there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles .\r\n",
      "-1 the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .\r\n",
      "+1 not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it .\r\n",

      "+1 the gentle comic treatment of adolescent sturm und drang should please fans of chris fuhrman's posthumously published cult novel .\r\n",
      "+1 a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women .\r\n",

      "-1 yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .\r\n",
      "+1 though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance .\r\n",
      "-1 represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen .\r\n",
      "-1 a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well .\r\n",

      "+1 dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch .\r\n",

      "-1 if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be \" how does steven seagal come across these days ? \" or maybe \" how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ?\r\n",

      "-1 the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .\r\n",
      "-1 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .\r\n",
      "-1 the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .\r\n",
      "-1 makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .\r\n",
      "-1 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .\r\n",
      "+1 this is one of the year's best films .\r\n",
      "+1 gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways .\r\n",

      "-1 the film's essentially over by the meet-cute .\r\n",
      "-1 what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .\r\n",

      "-1 the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental .\r\n",

      "+1 over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance .\r\n",
      "+1 as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism .\r\n",
      "-1 a singularly off-putting romantic comedy .\r\n",

      "-1 a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc .\r\n",
      "-1 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies .\r\n",
      "-1 it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .\r\n",
      "+1 though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding .\r\n",
      "-1 shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .\r\n",

      "+1 birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments .\r\n",
      "+1 what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice .\r\n",

      "+1 while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing .\r\n",
      "+1 with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone\r\n",

      "+1 as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records .\r\n",

      "+1 jones . . . does offer a brutal form of charisma .\r\n",

      "+1 we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones .\r\n",

      "-1 a puzzling experience .\r\n",

      "-1 traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill .\r\n",

      "-1 a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff .\r\n",

      "-1 it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective .\r\n",

      "-1 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .\r\n",
      "+1 the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( \" laissez-passer \" ) wears its heart on its sleeve .\r\n",

      "-1 a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .\r\n",

      "+1 the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear .\r\n",

      "-1 it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .\r\n",

      "-1 releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them .\r\n",

      "-1 too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .\r\n",
      "-1 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace .\r\n",
      "+1 an entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller .\r\n",
      "+1 that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . .\r\n",

      "-1 seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors .\r\n",
      "-1 a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy .\r\n",

      "+1 intriguing and downright intoxicating .\r\n",

      "+1 mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub .\r\n",

      "+1 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder .\r\n",
      "-1 there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .\r\n",

      "-1 on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .\r\n",

      "+1 [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority .\r\n",
      "+1 [shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .\r\n",
      "+1 it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions .\r\n",
      "+1 overall , it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .\r\n",
      "+1 it just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read stevenson's book , which is a treasure in and of itself .\r\n",
      "+1 you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings .\r\n",

      "+1 this time out , [sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested .\r\n",
      "+1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive .\r\n",
      "-1 somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .\r\n",
      "-1 it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s .\r\n",

      "-1 irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .\r\n",
      "-1 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .\r\n",
      "-1 suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .\r\n",
      "-1 i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .\r\n",

      "-1 cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .\r\n",

      "+1 this is a superior horror flick .\r\n",
      "-1 an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .\r\n",

      "-1 some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .\r\n",

      "+1 while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth .\r\n",
      "-1 don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .\r\n",
      "+1 we know the plot's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish .\r\n",
      "+1 adam sandler ! in an art film !\r\n",
      "+1 no , it's not as single-minded as john carpenter's original , but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels .\r\n",
      "+1 filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home .\r\n",
      "+1 jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair .\r\n",
      "+1 woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz .\r\n",

      "-1 the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .\r\n",
      "-1 . . . post-september 11 , \" the sum of all fears \" seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .\r\n",

      "+1 exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere .\r\n",

      "+1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives .\r\n",
      "-1 it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making .\r\n",
      "+1 the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . it's sort of in-between , and it works .\r\n",
      "+1 the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry .\r\n",
      "+1 a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect .\r\n",
      "+1 while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy .\r\n",

      "-1 static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .\r\n",
      "+1 a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two\r\n",

      "+1 worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film .\r\n",
      "-1 [screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .\r\n",
      "+1 woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos .\r\n",
      "-1 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .\r\n",
      "+1 stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be .\r\n",
      "-1 in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works .\r\n",
      "+1 a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary .\r\n",

      "-1 this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .\r\n",
      "+1 it's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i'd say the film works .\r\n",
      "+1 a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe .\r\n",
      "+1 a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats .\r\n",

      "-1 beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .\r\n",
      "-1 watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .\r\n",

      "-1 a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing .\r\n",
      "-1 it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .\r\n",

      "-1 tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .\r\n",
      "-1 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .\r\n",
      "+1 more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . .\r\n",
      "+1 here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get .\r\n",
      "+1 an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't .\r\n",
      "-1 while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier .\r\n",
      "-1 it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons  a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .\r\n",

      "-1 a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .\r\n",

      "+1 ' . . . despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '\r\n",
      "+1 a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama .\r\n",
      "-1 stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition  wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text  when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .\r\n",
      "-1 try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .\r\n",
      "-1 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .\r\n",
      "+1 the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .\r\n",
      "+1 like a poor man's you can count on me\r\n",
      "+1 happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and doesn't pummel us with phony imagery or music .\r\n",

      "-1 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .\r\n",
      "-1 a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world .\r\n",
      "+1 spielberg's picture is smarter and subtler than [total recall and blade runner] , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .\r\n",
      "+1 the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed .\r\n",
      "+1 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents .\r\n",

      "-1 clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence .\r\n",
      "+1 if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .\r\n",

      "+1 o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing .\r\n",
      "-1 for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .\r\n",
      "+1 like mike is a harmlessly naïve slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba's off-season .\r\n",
      "-1 though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful .\r\n",
      "-1 nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .\r\n",

      "-1 the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .\r\n",
      "-1 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance .\r\n",

      "-1 the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .\r\n",
      "+1 peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery\r\n",
      "+1 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances\r\n",

      "+1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .\r\n",
      "+1 the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year .\r\n",
      "+1 both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece .\r\n",
      "+1 it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics .\r\n",
      "-1 it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable .\r\n",
      "-1 it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .\r\n",
      "+1 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to .\r\n",
      "-1 a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .\r\n",
      "+1 if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot .\r\n",
      "+1 an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race .\r\n",
      "+1 moonlight mile doesn't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy .\r\n",
      "-1 . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .\r\n",
      "+1 imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made .\r\n",
      "-1 apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess .\r\n",
      "-1 do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ?\r\n",
      "+1 a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court's extradition chess game and the regime's talking-head survivors .\r\n",
      "-1 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .\r\n",
      "-1 feeble comedy .\r\n",
      "-1 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .\r\n",
      "+1 this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be .\r\n",
      "-1 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant .\r\n",
      "-1 this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio .\r\n",
      "-1 despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie\r\n",
      "+1 the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but ",
      " in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has  ironically - distanced us from the characters .\r\n",
      "+1 apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen .\r\n",
      "-1 a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '\r\n",
      "+1 affectionately reminds us that , in any language , the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things .\r\n",
      "-1 much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .\r\n",
      "+1 made me unintentionally famous  as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby . but believe it or not , it's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i've seen .\r\n",
      "+1 a bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy .\r\n",
      "+1 at the end , when the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside .\r\n",
      "+1 if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 .\r\n",
      "-1 as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen .\r\n",
      "-1 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .\r\n",
      "+1 the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people .\r\n",
      "+1 a crisp psychological drama [and] a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old \" twilight zone \" episode .\r\n",
      "+1 it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters .\r\n",
      "+1 whether or not you buy mr . broomfield's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr . broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover .\r\n",
      "-1 watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost .\r\n",
      "+1 impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation . . . just about as chilling and unsettling as 'manhunter' was .\r\n",
      "+1 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining .\r\n",
      "+1 poignant and delicately complex .\r\n",
      "-1 while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .\r\n",
      "-1 an often unfunny romp .\r\n",
      "+1 it's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience .\r\n",
      "+1 my thoughts were focused on the characters . that is a compliment to kuras and miller . if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong .\r\n",
      "+1 the best comedy concert movie i've seen since cho's previous concert comedy film , i'm the one that i want , in 2000 .\r\n",
      "+1 in the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama how i killed my father , french director anne fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition\r\n",
      "-1 the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch .\r\n",
      "-1 leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .\r\n",
      "-1 despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there\r\n",
      "+1 frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .\r\n",
      "-1 a selection of scenes in search of a movie .\r\n",
      "+1 smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .\r\n",
      "+1 visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it's the very definition of epic adventure .\r\n",
      "-1 it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt .\r\n",
      "-1 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .\r\n",
      "+1 i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible .\r\n",
      "+1 the lady and the duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the french revolution from the aristocrats' perspective .\r\n",
      "+1 while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving .\r\n",
      "+1 secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion .\r\n",
      "-1 a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .\r\n",
      "-1 horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists .\r\n",
      "-1 adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie .\r\n",
      "-1 i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '\r\n",
      "-1 as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising .\r\n",
      "+1 spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here , thankfully , they are .\r\n",
      "-1 the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .\r\n",
      "-1 often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? into how long is this movie ?\r\n",
      "+1 ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel .\r\n",
      "+1 an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence .\r\n",
      "-1 meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .\r\n",
      "+1 escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions .\r\n",
      "-1 halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .\r\n",
      "+1 a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age .\r\n",
      "+1 [ferrera] has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen .\r\n",
      "+1 \" catch me \" feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark .\r\n",
      "+1 the audacity to view one of shakespeare's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion .\r\n",
      "-1 here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha .\r\n",
      "+1 many a parent and their teen ( or preteen ) kid could bond while watching a walk to remember . so could young romantics out on a date .\r\n",
      "+1 it's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son's room .\r\n",
      "+1 at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .\r\n",
      "-1 strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery .\r\n",
      "-1 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye .\r\n",
      "+1 \" me without you \" is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades .\r\n",
      "+1 one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work .\r\n",
      "-1 spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .\r\n",
      "+1 a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france's most inventive directors .\r\n",
      "-1 a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) .\r\n",
      "-1 it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .\r\n",
      "+1 alain choquart's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .\r\n",
      "-1 only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for .\r\n",
      "+1 a stirring road movie ."
